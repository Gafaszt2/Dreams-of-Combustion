Hertzog advocating for neutrality and General Jan Smuts pushing for participation on the side of the Allies. Ultimately, Smuts prevailed, and South Africa declared war on Germany and the Axis powers on September 6, 1939.

South African forces were involved in several key campaigns, including the North African and East African campaigns. The South African Air Force made notable contributions, such as performing the first Allied bombing run of the war2. South African troops also fought in Italy and Madagascar.

The war had a significant impact on South Africa's economy and society. The manufacturing industry expanded, and the number of people employed in this sector increased by 60% between 1939 and 1945. However, the post-war period brought challenges, including supply shortages and political resistance",

The region underwent a process of industrialization, marked by the development of key industries such as textiles, mining, and agriculture. Countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina saw the establishment of factories and the growth of urban centers. However, the region also faced challenges such as economic dependency on foreign investments and the exploitation of natural resources. Despite these obstacles, Latin America managed to modernize its infrastructure, improve education, and foster economic diversification",

                "text": "The Paraguayan War, or War of the Triple Alliance, fought by
Paraguay against Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay (1864-1870), remains
unique in the Latin American context in several respects. Dire in its
duration and human toll, the war's underlying conflict was not directly
related to specific boundary disagreements. Unlike other Latin American conflicts, the War of the Triple Alliance has stirred a passionate
controversy involving heavy ideological connotations, with some analysts viewing it as a struggle between civilization (the Alliance) and
barbarism (Paraguay) and others depicting it as a confrontation between British imperialism (the Alliance) and Latin American nationalism (Paraguay).
Many attempts have been made to explain this war. A number of
studies have assumed an apologetic approach (Garcia Mellid 1963;
Pomer 1968; Trias 1975). Some contain careful and detailed chronological accounts (Cardozo 1967a), and others present in-depth analysis of
the diplomatic and political dimensions of the conflict (Box 1948; Cardozo 1954, 1961). But excepting a few remarks by Robert Burr (1955), no
one has systematically applied insights from contemporary research on
international conflict to explain the war. Such is the goal of this article,
albeit as a preliminary exercise subject to further refinement.
Numerous benefits result from applying various theories of war
to the Triple Alliance conflict. First, this exercise submits previous interpretations of the war to more rigorous tests. Second, it assesses the
usefulness of concepts developed in the subdiscipline of international
politics. Third and even more important, it generates a healthy revision
of the conceptual tools used to explain armed conflicts in Latin America and opens doors to more fruitful interdisciplinary study of relations
among Latin American countries.
The first part of this study will briefly review the historical sequence of events that led to the war. Discussed next will be three competing models widely used in the literature on international relations to
explain the outbreak of armed conflict-imperialism, balance of power,
and power transition. 1 To ascertain their usefulness in explaining the
War of the Triple Alliance, the following section will provide the data
needed to test these models empirically. The last part will assess comparatively their explanatory power.",
